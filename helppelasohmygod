## the goal of this code is to estimate the amount of water in a barrel based on previous measurements, taken from 0-4 gallons
## the original measurements were taken from an ultrasonic sensor set up like this : https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-HC-SR04-sensor-used-to-measure-the-water-level_fig4_339286117
## it can interpolate fine but my problem is just inserting existing data into the new dataframe that contains every possible measurement, 50.0-100.0 cm
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


data = {
    0.5 : 100.0,
    1 : 99.7,
    2 : 85.0 ,
    3 : 70.0 ,
    4 : 50.0 ,
}

low = 50.0
high = 100.5
data2 = pd.DataFrame(list(data.items()), columns = ['gals', 'distance'])
theRay = np.arange(low, high , 0.1)
df = pd.DataFrame(theRay, columns =['distance'])
df['gals'] = np.nan

print(data2)

# data2 has the measured ones

for z in range(len(data2)):
    currNum = data2.distance[z]
    currGal = data2.gals[z]
    print(currNum)
    print(currGal)
    
    ## attempt 1
    df['gals'] = np.where(df['distance'] == currNum, currGal, df['gals'])
    
    ## attempt 2
#     condition = (df['distance'] == currNum)
#     df.loc[condition, 'gals'] = currGal

    ## attempt 3
    
#     df.loc[df['distance'] == currNum, 'gals'] = currGal


# i am going to kms this is so simple but the loop only inserts the first row, 50.0 = 0.4 gallons, idk  what is happening
print(df.info())
print(df)

# df = df.gals.interpolate()
# the last part is interpolating
